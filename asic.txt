We are in the process of writing our bachlor thesis which relates to blockchain techology, like the one used in Bitcoin. The process of verifing blocks on the blockchain involves computing the hash of a block+nonce until it reaches below a certain number. Today in Bitcoin the work of computing these hash-values as done by specilzed machines built around mining blocks. These machines can compute on the order of trillions of hashes a second. To be able to accurantly test scalibilty amongst other things we need an example of such a machine. This would give as a more accurate image of how different mining hardware stack up, and the pros and cons of using a proof-of-work system for verification.
